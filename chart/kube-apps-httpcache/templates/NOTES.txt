ATTENTION REQUIRED:
If any of your applications backend service is in a different namespace than your Helm release ({{ .Release.Namespace}}),
to be able to watch the endpoints of this service, the '{{ include "kube-apps-httpcache.serviceAccountName" . }}' service
account will need to be granted WATCH access to the "endpoints" resource in the application's namespace using RBAC.
