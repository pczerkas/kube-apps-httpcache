# Helm Chart for [kube-apps-httpcache](https://github.com/pczerkas/kube-apps-httpcache)

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```console
helm repo add kube-apps-httpcache https://pczerkas.github.io/kube-apps-httpcache
```

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve the latest versions of the packages.

You can then run `helm search repo kube-apps-httpcache` to see the charts.
